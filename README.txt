STEP BY STEP HOW TO RUN PROBLEM 1 & 2 (same execution see terminal).

1) Upload all source code files
	-DetectDownTime.java
	-DistributionCalculations.java
	-Main.java
	-Process.java

2) TXSTATE servers should have a JavaJDK available. Execute 'java --version' to check.

3) To compile: Execute 'javac Main.java'

4) To run: Execute 'java Main.java'

Terminal will output problem #1 as intended.
Terminal will output problem #2 by:
	-Listing every failure of server one. Also will contain information on server recovery.
	-Listing every failure of server two. Also will contain information on server recovery.
	-Listing average arrival times & failure rates for both servers.
	-Listing complete failure of both servers & at what hour this occurs.
